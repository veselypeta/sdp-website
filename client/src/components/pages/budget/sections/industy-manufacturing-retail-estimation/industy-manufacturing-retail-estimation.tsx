            <h2>Industry Manufacturing and Retail Estimation</h2>
            <p>
                If our product was to be manufactured for general use there would be some replacements of parts of the
                system that would make the process streamlined and mass-producible, in practice our product would have a
                similar manufacturing cycle to that of pre-existing kitchen appliances such as a microwave (MadeHow,
                2020a) and a washing machine (MadeHow, 2020b).{' '}
            </p>

                The outer walls and gear enclosure shroud can be substituted with a one-piece, wrap around metal
                enclosure to ensure strong, safe walls that would not be easily punctured from general wear-and-tear or
                while in transit for shipment. The door to access the insides of the system would be based off of a
                plastic washing machine door as that is an ideal standard, it is both light enough to open and close and
                includes a tempered-glass window that can withstand high bearing loads. Inside the system, the inside
                panels and door would be made of galvanised or stainless steel and coated in a lightly coloured acrylic
                enamel, to give good visibility, this would ensure easy cleaning in case of spillages, while all the
                gears and other fixings like axles, spacers, etc. would be generic metal parts and would be shielded
                with plastic to ensure there would be no contact with water.

                With these considerations, including that processes like this are already in place for other
                mass-produced kitchen appliances, costs would be between the bounds of a mid-range microwave and a
                mid-range food processor due to the similarities in the moving parts and housing, so our estimation
                would be Â£40-50.
