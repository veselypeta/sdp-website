                In the UK alone over 10 million people suffer from some form of arthritis, and the hand is the most
                commonly affected area (NHS, 2018); the lifetime risk of osteoarthritis in the hands is almost 40% (Jin
                Qin, 2017); alongside this over a million people in the UK suffer a tremor of some kind (NTF); as well
                as low grip strength and reduced dexterity are issues potentially faced in life as a person ages, and in
                our aging society that is a large part of the market (ONS, 2019). There are also neurological conditions
                such as Parkinsonâ€™s which can cause tremors or affect coordination. In addition, from personal
                experience of family members, we know that previous injuries, especially in those of older age, can be
                hard to recover from and this can cause similar issues to the medical conditions outlined above.
